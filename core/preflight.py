"""
Preflight package check.

Several troubleshooting fault-injectors and positive-configuration tasks
assume common exam-relevant packages already exist on the box (httpd,
vsftpd, nfs-utils, samba, chrony...). A minimal RHEL/Rocky/Alma install
often doesn't have them. When a package is missing, a task's
inject_fault()/setup_environment() call still "succeeds" (its own commands
just no-op or fail silently) so the resulting scenario looks like it was
never created — e.g. an httpd 403 troubleshooting task where httpd was
never actually running.

This module runs a read-only `rpm -q` check at startup and warns about
what's missing so the gap is visible up front instead of surfacing later
as a confusing "nothing happened" task.
